### When to use t Object Pool pattern 

You need to frequently create and destroy objects, leading to high resource allocation and de-allocation costs.
The objects are expensive to create and maintain (e.g., database connections, thread pools).
A fixed number of objects need to be controlled, like in connection pooling.
Object reuse can significantly improve system performance and resource management.


### Real-World Applications of Object Mother Pattern in Java

* Database connection pooling in Java applications.
* Thread pooling in Java concurrent programming.
* Pooling of socket connections in network applications.
* Object pools in game development for frequently created and destroyed game objects.

### Benefits and Trade-offs of Object Pool Pattern

Benefits:

* Improved Performance: Reduces the overhead of object creation and garbage collection.
* Resource Management: Controls the number of instances, reducing resource contention and limiting resource usage.
* Scalability: Allows the application to handle more requests by reusing a fixed number of objects.

Trade-offs:
 
* Complexity: Adds complexity to the codebase, requiring careful management of the pool.
* Thread Safety: Requires careful handling of concurrent access to the pool, introducing potential synchronization issues.
* Initialization Cost: Initial creation of the pool can be resource-intensive.
